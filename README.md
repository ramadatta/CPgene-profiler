# CPgene-profiler
# We want to find the CPgenes from a bacterial assembly and plot a heatmap of CP genes from all the assemblies based on the categories of carbapenamases
# First step is to blast the Assembly against CP gene and find the list of the contigs with CP genes
# Second, the CP genes are assigned to the Assembly file and a table is created
# From the table a heatmap is drawn
